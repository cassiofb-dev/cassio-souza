Hi, Cassio here.

This week was really hard for me and today I saw the news that Toriyama is dead...
I write this in memory of his legacy that gave me a lot of awesome moments of my and my friends childhoods.
Your legacy is for sure in good hands with Oda and Kishimoto, rest in peace!

## Thanks

It's crying that I'm writing this, but I really want to thank you for your works that were amazing for me:

### Dragon Ball

I saw this multiple times on my childhood, for sure it made me a better person and game lots of happy times for me and my friends too.

### Chrono Trigger

For me this was the best RPG I played. I also beat it multiple times and every time I am satisfied with the experience.

### Dr. Slump and Ginga Patrol Jako

I only read those works once but they gave me good laughs, thanks.

### Dragon Ball Super

[This is one of few anime endings that made me cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27q1-ld66is).\
I saw just the start of it but I liked, I just don't have that much time as I was a kid but I'll see it for sure...

## Farewell

I wasn't the only one affected and saddened with your parting but the whole world, we also make tributes for you.
