## September 2023 Update

Now RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT are included.
I also added base GPU option that will make all results normalized by the desired GPU for easier comparison.

## Rasterization Data

The table bellow shows the benchmark results for rasterization, you can also divide the results for some other data in the select bellow.
