## Construction

The little tank name is really a good name for him for it, this smartphone has IP68, IP69K and MIL-STD-810H certifications. It's design is really good for this type of phone but it's huger and heavier than common smartphones (not heavy and huge enough to be a burden though). A notable feature that is obvious in the smartphone is the 1200 Lumens camping light (brighter than my room lights ðŸ˜…). Bellow are some pictures of the box and smartphone.

## Temperature

While traveling with him I recorded videos, took pictures and played a heavy game called Genshin Impact. On all situations I didn't noticed heat from the phone, the max temp on the sensor was around 30Â°c. The highest temperature I noticed was charging at 47Â°c with 66W fast charge. Having said that this phone also has a 6W TDP CPU so temperature will not be a problem.

## Performance

As I said, while traveling I played Genshin Impact. The install was really fast and the gameplay was really smooth.

### Geekbench 6

#### CPU

In terms of benchmark this phone scored 730 points on single core and 2020 points on multi core in Geekbench 6. This is a high enough score for everyday usage and even some heavy gaming.

#### GPU

On GPU side it score 1300 points on OpenCL and 1281 points on Vulkan, this is a good score for gaming as we will see soon.

## Battery

With all awesome features I think this is simply the best! The battery was fine without charging for a whole week and now that I am not using it intensively it's at 50% with 6 days usage. Bellow I'll share some charging screenshots that I took.

### Less than 10% charging
